## ðŸ§° Tools and Libraries

- **Python**
- **Pandas** for data manipulation
- **NumPy** for numerical operations
- **Seaborn** and **Matplotlib** for data visualization

## ðŸ“Š Data Cleaning Steps

- Replaced blank values in `TotalCharges` with 0 and converted it to `float`.
- Verified no missing values were left after cleaning.
- Converted the `SeniorCitizen` column from numeric (0/1) to categorical ("No"/"Yes").
- Checked and confirmed no duplicate `customerID` entries.

1. **Churn Distribution**
   - Overall churn percentage visualized.

## ðŸ“ˆ Key Insights

- **Senior Citizens** tend to churn more compared to others.
- **Month-to-month contracts** are risky; customers are more likely to leave.

## ðŸ’¡ Recommendations

1. Offer incentives for customers to switch to **long-term contracts** (e.g., yearly plans).
2. Encourage **auto-payment options** (like bank transfer/credit card) instead of electronic checks.
3. Target **new customers** (low tenure) with loyalty programs and better onboarding support.
4. Bundle additional services like **tech support** and **security** to increase customer stickiness.
